# In side Hillary Clinton's Emails
***
Throughout 2015, Hillary Clinton has been embroiled in controversy over the use of personal email accounts on non-government servers during her time as the United States Secretary of State. Some political experts and opponents maintain that Clinton's use of personal email accounts to conduct Secretary of State affairs is in violation of protocols and federal laws that ensure appropriate recordkeeping of government activity. Hillary's campaign has provided their own four sentence summary of her email use here.

There have been a number of Freedom of Information lawsuits filed over the State Department's failure to fully release the emails sent and received on Clinton's private accounts. On Monday, August 31, the State Department released nearly 7,000 pages of Clinton's heavily redacted emails (its biggest release of emails to date).

The documents were released by the State Department as PDFs. We've cleaned and normalized the released documents and are hosting them for public analysis. Kaggle's choice to host this dataset is not meant to express any particular political affiliation or intent.

Here are a few comments and questions: We need to work in reference and quotes from POTUS Nobel speech near the top. I haven't read it yet so not sure what's most appriopriate. Since the speech alluded to some of the same ground, should we be explicit in asserting that this speech further clarifies/expands/explains what this Admin means by human rights? The points about us not being perfect and the existence of evil in the POTUS speech should be woven in more here too. For example, in discussion on p.7 about Japanese internment, etc. In the section about supporting individual defenders, should mention that we did that thru State Dept ceremony honoring brave women and applaud others like Vital Voices and RFK memorial who do same. Tell story about how I was asked to mention the name of a Guatemala activist in my sppech to the parliament there because the attention might literally save her life. Look forward to further discussion later today.</th>\n",

Obama's pause on Afghanistan goes well with elite media and left that is against all wars, but not with swing male voters who are defecting. And I think it is making the rest of your job much tougher because the delay in the decision is looking Carterlike to US adversaries â€” any decision is better than no decision.

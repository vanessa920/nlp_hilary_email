One of this group's big pitches is that they'll be the first to generate a revenue stream (""shovel-ready, in the ground, the day after the award."") And thanks to the reader who alerted us to this article in Crain's <http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20090913/FREE/309139964> which, more importantly than comprising yet another virtual press release for Steve Wynn, contains, towards the bottom, a handy pocket guide to the six bidders, the financial portion of their bids (or at least what is known about them), and the ups and downs of their proposals. This is a tough call; handicapping without the Form as I said before. I can't say I have a favorite; neither a particular personal preference, nor a clue as to the most likely winner. But I'll give it a shot and take the Crain's piece one step further by coming up with a morning line. <http://1.bp.blogspot.com/yiJ1ri4LCfk/Sq2_nTNU jI/AAAAAAAABHM/UucITWnkilM/s1600- h/dont_bother.jpg> Aqueduct Entertainment Group <http://www.aqueductentertainment.comk (3-1): Competitive bid of $251 million (contingent on 7,650 machines; $301 million with 10,000), a plethora of local connections on the real estate/construction side, and approval by local unions could compensate for the lack of brand name recognition of gaming partner The Navegante Group. Presence of Senator Malcolm Smith's longtime confidante Rev. Floyd Flake doesn't hurt either. SL Green/Hard Rock (4-1) - Boosted its bid to $275 million, and has the Hard Rock brand name as mentioned above. Manhattan-based realtor SL Green has been endorsed by several local unions <http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3601/is_43_54/ai_n27894917/> . But, as mentioned by Crain's, they were passed over in favor of Delaware North the first time around. Aqueduct Gaming (6-1), Buffalo-based Delaware North's group, has rallied late with a stepped-up publicity effort and a major community initiative <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/back-in-game.html> after appearing indifferent early on (though it's original $100 million upfront offer remains intact with an additional $200 million to follow). The addition of Harrah's <http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Aqueduct-Gaming-L1c-1034906.html> adds an experienced operator and an interesting cross-marketing twist which is probably not allowed under the now- disappeared MOU. And, like the two bidders above, Aqueduct Gaming has been reported to have reached accommodations with the unions. So I listed them as the third choice on these merits. However, a part of me wants to list them as the rank outsider - I'd be pretty damn shocked if the state goes back to the company which dropped out after failing to raise the money last time. And, as I've mentioned several times, given the reports of an investigation <http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/05/01/2009-05- 01_attorney_general_andrew_cuomo_subpoenas_contracts_won_by_clients_offirm_tied_to.html> by Attorney General Andrew Cuomo into lobbyist Patricia Lynch's dealings with the Assembly Speaker, I don't know if her involvement here is going to help or hurt. Steve Wynn (8-1) has offered $300 million, but he was the only bidder of the six contenders to receive a bad grade from the hotel unions <http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storylD=838256&category=STATE> as reported by Jim Odato in the Times Union last week. Whatsmore, the scale of his building proposal <http://www.queenstribune.com/news/1250798405.html> is laughably ridiculous, and it wouldn't be ready until 2011. He'd be the favorite if the decision is based on the number of newspaper and online articles <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/all-wynn-all-of-time.html> each bidder has been featured in. But, quite simply, he sometimes comes off as a nut <http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/cindy_adams/wynn_hopes_to_win_racefor_race_hzqJ384wLxUSxFKsUWiSyM> . Penn National (12-1) might be worth a ducat at long odds. No local connection here makes them a dark horse. But a $250 million bid (as reported elsewhere <http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/17717/penn-national- lobbies-up/> though not in the Crain's piece) puts them in the ballgame, and the company is an experienced gaming operator with a solid balance sheet <http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/aug2009/pi20090814_742719.htm> which would probably do as competent a job as anyone else. R. Donahue Peebles/MGM Mirage (20-1) didn't increase its $150 million bid, and doesn't have a lobbyist; good luck with that. Whatsmore, no local flavor and MGM Mirage has had some well-publicized financial woes (though things have been looking up of late <http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125212120561188377.html> ). Would be a major surprise.

I am making FM calls re Afghanistan which are going well and the memcons will describe the specific responses for our followup, especially in Athens and Brussels. Below is a memo from a concerned observer about the British feeling alienated from us. /Let me know what you each think. Thx. Consensus across the board in Britain—center, right, left—is that the Atlantic alliance—the special relationship—the historic bond since World War II—is shattered. There is no dissenting voice, not one, and there are no illusions. Opinion is unanimous. The bottom line is that the Obama administration's denigration of the UK is seen as the summation of the Bush era. Undoubtedly, you saw this week Minister of Defense Bob Ainsworth's public criticism of Obama's indecision and his accusation that the president is indifferent and damaging to British interest. While Downing Street sought to ameliorate his remarks with an oleaginous statement his view is simply what everyone—everyone—thinks. His clumsy outburst was a classic gaffe—an embarrassing mistake because it reveals something true. The Chilcot inquiry of Parliament, publicly conducting hearings on the origins of UK involvement in the Iraq invasion, has put Bush's war on terror—and British involvement—on trial—and the calmly conducted but eviscerating hearings will go on for another year. Blair is seen as either complicit on the basis of knowing there was no casus belli or as an enthusiastically deceived tool. Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has stated that the reason support for the Afghanistan mission has cratered is because of the lies told in the run-up to the Iraq war—another view universally held. Meanwhile, former UK ambassador to the US Christopher Meyer has published his new book on the history of UK diplomacy with concluding sections on the demise of the special relationship. He is not only being interviewed on all British media but also has appeared as a voluble witness before the Chi!cot commission. All British newspapers and journals have prominently published many pieces within the last week on the decline and fall of the US-UK relationship. Please see the lead editorial today from the London Times and the cover story from the Spectator—two of the most resolutely pro-American sources. The tone is not resentful, but reserved, disdainful and superior. The US administration is considered blinkered, parochial and counter-productive. Conservatives are more contemptuous than Labour, which feels abandoned and somewhat baffled. Rather than eager to be Obama's poodle, Cameron would be superficially friendly and privately scornful. Class has a lot to do with the contempt. A Cameron government would be more aristocratic and even narrowly Etonian than any Conservative government in recent history, sharply contrasting especially with the striving and classless perspective of the grocer's daughter, Margaret Thatcher. And yet, the most recent poll this week showed Labour within striking distance of the Tories, about five points down, the result of a slight economic uptick. A hung parliament seems very possible. Given the distribution of voting patterns, Labour need not win a plurality to have more seats than the Tories. The slight buoyancy for Labour in this unique situation has only heightened anxiety about Obama's Afghanistan process, which has excluded the British government from significant consultation and consideration of its interests. See the lead to Con Coughlin's Spectator piece. Therefore, the President might contemplate a brief stop in London going to or coming from Oslo or a meeting in Copenhage to make a public appearance with Brown. And, others in the Administration should pay special attention to Brown to secure strong support from him, and more importantly, the whole government and British establishment should be reassured that we do value their stalwart support despite the ups and downs of the last eight years. Pasted below is the Times editorial and the link to the Spectator article. From The Times November 26, 2009 Atlantic drift Washington's delay in announcing its Afghanistan strategy has left Brown drifting. Obama needs to invest more time and attention in the transatlantic alliance President Obama declared on Tuesday that ""the whole world"" had a responsibility to help the US-led mission in Afghanistan. He would, he said; soon lay out the ""obligations of our international partners"". Those partners have been waiting a long time for the details. On Monday the President had his tenth meeting with his advisers to work out his strategy for Afghanistan. He has now spent almost three months considering his options, and has promised an announcement on deployments after the Thanksgiving holiday. For Gordon Brown, this cannot come too soon. After the United States, Britain is the largest contributor of troops to the Nato operation in Afghanistan. There has never been any suggestion that Britain has enough soldiers to pursue a separate strategy or that it can operate independently of the US forces, which already number some 68,000 troops. Until the White House decides whether to send an extra 40,000 or some figure significantly lower than the number requested by General Stanley McChrystal, Mr Brown cannot properly plan the best support strategy. It is becoming sadly apparent that Britain has been left drifting by the delays in Washington, and that the Obama Administration is largely unaware of the embarrassment this is causing the Government. More worryingly, this does not seem to be a source of concern within the Administration. Downing Street, diplomatically, turns aside any suggestion that it is frustrated by the nonchalance with which it is being treated. But the insistent questions on Afghanistan, the anger caused by the steady stream of returning war dead and the rapid crumbling of public support for the war cannot be answered effectively until Mr Brown is taken into American confidence and seen as a full partner in the Nato campaign. On the surface, the continuing high regard in Britain for the dynamic and articulate new President has masked these growling complaints. Mr Brown is not suffering, as his predecessor did, from the taint of close association with a deeply unpopular US president. On the contrary: like several European leaders, he is still eager to position himself as close as possible to Mr Obama to clothe himself in some of the President's European popularity.

This is not simply another instance of the persistent but pointless British anxiety over the so-called special relationship; it is a justified concern that two of the main pillars of the Nato alliance should have policies and strategies that are closely co-ordinated and sympathetically understood on both sides when fighting a war.

Mr Obama promised during his election campaign to revive trust in American leadership and to re-engage in multinational diplomacy. In office, he has certainly voiced the same ideals; but he has invested little in giving new substance and dynamism to the transatlantic relationship. On Afghanistan, Mr Brown has sometimes been left speechless by Washington. He talks of sending 500 extra troops. But until he knows the likely US strategy, he cannot outline his own. Atlanticism is always fragile on the Left and was stretched to breaking point by Tony Blair. It is now being undermined by indifference in Washington. Today America is enjoying Thanksgiving.

Here are a few comments and questions: We need to work in reference and quotes from POTUS Nobel speech near the top. I haven't read it yet so not sure what's most appriopriate. Since the speech alluded to some of the same ground, should we be explicit in asserting that this speech further clarifies/expands/explains what this Admin means by human rights? The points about us not being perfect and the existence of evil in the POTUS speech should be woven in more here too. For example, in discussion on p.7 about Japanese internment, etc. In the section about supporting individual defenders, should mention that we did that thru State Dept ceremony honoring brave women and applaud others like Vital Voices and RFK memorial who do same. Tell story about how I was asked to mention the name of a Guatemala activist in my sppech to the parliament there because the attention might literally save her life.

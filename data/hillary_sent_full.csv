276,185,Robert Russo,2012-07-17T04:00:00+00:00,Another report SOURCE Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council as well as the highest levels of European Governments and Western Intelligence and security services As of the morning of July an individual with access to the information stated in confidence that Libyan National Transitional Council NTC President Mustafa Abdel Jalil remains committed to transfer of power to popularly elected government however he is prepared to ex tend the life of the NTC as guarantor of stability for the Libyan people following the July election for seats in member General National Congress GNC Jaifi realizes that million Libyans have registered to vote and are generally anxious to replace the increasingly unpopular NTC That said JAI expects the voting to lead to period of confusion and he will not abandon his authority until the results are fixed Jalil is also frustrated by the fact that during its eight month tenure of the administration of Prime Minister Abclel Rahman el Keib who was appointed by the NTC was unable to provide solutions for Libyas long list of needs functioning justice system reconciliation process for officials who served the old administration the disarming of militia building functional national security forces rebuilding destroyed areas and delivering basic services such as healthcare At the same time outside of the oil sector much of Libyas economy is stagnant and in the opinion of Western security officials lacks the governments go ahead to restart public sector infrastructure contracts In addition international advisers and foreign investors are reluctant to return to an environment where the government will not sign long term agreements and cannot guarantee security Source Comment According to an extremely sensitive source Jalil continues to believe that this chaotic situation should not be surprising He regularly points out that eight months is not sufficient amount of time to build functioning institutions from the remnants of the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi The old regime featured dysfunctional bureaucracy idiosyncratic rule and anti institutionalism Additionally Jaill now re Ializes that due to pronounced incompetence and lack of will to take unpopular decisions the el Keib government also failed to make progress in the few areas where it could have achieved meaningful change The towns of Sirte and Tawargha are representative of the situation in the countryside where people lost their homes in the conflict and have been living in temporary camps with limited ability to register and vote in their home district Jalil has been urged by contacts in the French and Italian Governments to guarantee the rights of people across the country in particular he has serious concerns as to whether or not supporters of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi in his hometown of Sirte will be included in the future political processes of the new Libya if they are not allowed to vote by local militiamen At the same time the fighting between Libyan Arabs and Tebta tribesmen in the Kufra area threatens to prevent any voting there Jalil has been warned that the NTC regulations now state that members of the National Army are not allowed to vote or run for office which is disincentive for armed militia brigade members to become legitimate soldiers This well informed individual believes that despite these flaws the new government created by the July election will eventually have the mandate to take the difficult decisions that can create reconciliation process Jalil will work to maintain order in this transition period and finally reach his goal of creating situation where the government can rebuild homes and restore sufficient law and order allowing those in Sirte Tawargha Kufra and throughout the rest of the country to live in their hometowns establishing situation where true civil society can develop US Department of State

SCB,"Another report-- SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services. 1. As of the morning of July 6, an individual with access to the information stated in confidence that Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil remains committed to a transfer of power to a popularly elected government; however, he is prepared to ex-tend the life of the NTC as a guarantor of stability for the Libyan people following the July 7, 2012 election for seats in a 200-member General National Congress (GNC). Jaifi realizes that 2.7 million Libyans have registered to vote and are generally anxious to replace the increasingly unpopular NTC. That said, JAI expects the voting to lead to a period of confusion and he will not abandon his authority until the results are fixed. 2. Jalil is also frustrated by the fact that during its eight-month tenure of the administration of Prime Minister Abclel Rahman el-Keib - who was appointed by the NTC was unable to provide solutions for Libya's long list of needs: a functioning justice system, a reconciliation process for officials who served the old administration, the disarming of militia, building functional national security forces, rebuilding destroyed areas, and delivering basic services such as healthcare. 3. At the same time, outside of the oil sector, much of Libya's economy is stagnant, and in the opinion of Western security officials, lacks the government's go-ahead to restart public sector infrastructure contracts. In addition, international advisers and foreign investors are reluctant to return to an environment where the government will not sign long term agreements and cannot guarantee security. 4.(Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil continues to believe that this chaotic situation should not be surprising. He regularly points out that eight months is not a sufficient amount of time to build functioning institutions from the remnants of the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. The old regime featured a dysfunctional bureaucracy, idiosyncratic rule, and anti-institutionalism. Additionally, Jaill now re Ializes that due to pronounced incompetence and a lack of will to take unpopular decisions the el-Keib government also failed to make progress in the few areas where it could have achieved meaningful change. The towns of Sirte and Tawargha are representative of the situation in the countryside where people lost their homes in the conflict and have been living in temporary camps with limited ability to register and vote in their home district. Jalil has been urged by contacts in the French and Italian Governments to guarantee the rights of people across the country in particular, he has serious concerns as to whether or not supporters of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi in his hometown of Sirte will be included in the future political processes of the new Libya; if they are not allowed to vote by local militiamen. At the same time, the fighting between Libyan Arabs and Tebta tribesmen in the Kufra area threatens to prevent any voting there. Jalil has been warned that the NTC regulations now state that members of the National Army are not allowed to vote or run for office, which is a disincentive for armed militia brigade members to become legitimate soldiers.) 5.This well informed individual believes that despite these flaws, the new government created by the July 7 election will eventually have the mandate to take the difficult decisions that can create a reconciliation process. Jalil will work to maintain order in this transition period, and finally reach his goal of creating a situation where the government can rebuild homes and restore sufficient law and order; allowing those in Sirte, Tawargha, Kufra, and throughout the rest of the country to live in their hometowns, establishing a situation where a true civil society can develop.

Jail!, in conversations with the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), and separately with liberal leader Ali Tarhouni, has acknowledged that the central government's top priority must be security and that the NTC has been unable to provide it. That said, Jail! and Minister of Defense Ousarna alefuwali have pledged to provide 30,000 to 40,000 security personnel for election day to prevent similar incidents to the July 1 attack on Benghazi's election headquarters. In that case eastern federalists entered the building, where ballot papers were burned and ballot boxes destroyed. Similarly, these federalist forces are suspected of the attack on July 5 that burned down Ajdabiya's main storage centre for election materials. 7. In the opinion of this individual, although those responsible for the Benghazi attack were pro-federalist, it has not been proven that they were members of the self-appointed Cyrenaican National Council (MC), whose military arm set up a roadblock in Wadi al-Ahmar on Libya's major east-west highway to demand that Cyrenaica get as many seats in the GNC as Tripolitania. Thus far, neither the CNC nor any other group has publicly stated that they intend to use violence to disrupt the elections.

But I'll give it a shot and take the Crain's piece one step further by coming up with a morning line. <http://1.bp.blogspot.com/yiJ1ri4LCfk/Sq2_nTNU jI/AAAAAAAABHM/UucITWnkilM/s1600- h/dont_bother.jpg> Aqueduct Entertainment Group <http://www.aqueductentertainment.comk (3-1): Competitive bid of $251 million (contingent on 7,650 machines; $301 million with 10,000), a plethora of local connections on the real estate/construction side, and approval by local unions could compensate for the lack of brand name recognition of gaming partner The Navegante Group. Presence of Senator Malcolm Smith's longtime confidante Rev. Floyd Flake doesn't hurt either. SL Green/Hard Rock (4-1) - Boosted its bid to $275 million, and has the Hard Rock brand name as mentioned above. Manhattan-based realtor SL Green has been endorsed by several local unions <http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3601/is_43_54/ai_n27894917/> . But, as mentioned by Crain's, they were passed over in favor of Delaware North the first time around. Aqueduct Gaming (6-1), Buffalo-based Delaware North's group, has rallied late with a stepped-up publicity effort and a major community initiative <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/back-in-game.html> after appearing indifferent early on (though it's original $100 million upfront offer remains intact with an additional $200 million to follow). The addition of Harrah's <http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Aqueduct-Gaming-L1c-1034906.html> adds an experienced operator and an interesting cross-marketing twist which is probably not allowed under the now- disappeared MOU. And, like the two bidders above, Aqueduct Gaming has been reported to have reached accommodations with the unions. So I listed them as the third choice on these merits. However, a part of me wants to list them as the rank outsider - I'd be pretty damn shocked if the state goes back to the company which dropped out after failing to raise the money last time. And, as I've mentioned several times, given the reports of an investigation <http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/05/01/2009-05- 01_attorney_general_andrew_cuomo_subpoenas_contracts_won_by_clients_offirm_tied_to.html> by Attorney General Andrew Cuomo into lobbyist Patricia Lynch's dealings with the Assembly Speaker, I don't know if her involvement here is going to help or hurt. Steve Wynn (8-1) has offered $300 million, but he was the only bidder of the six contenders to receive a bad grade from the hotel unions <http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storylD=838256&category=STATE> as reported by Jim Odato in the Times Union last week. Whatsmore, the scale of his building proposal <http://www.queenstribune.com/news/1250798405.html> is laughably ridiculous, and it wouldn't be ready until 2011. He'd be the favorite if the decision is based on the number of newspaper and online articles <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/all-wynn-all-of-time.html> each bidder has been featured in. But, quite simply, he sometimes comes off as a nut <http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/cindy_adams/wynn_hopes_to_win_racefor_race_hzqJ384wLxUSxFKsUWiSyM> . Penn National (12-1) might be worth a ducat at long odds. No local connection here makes them a dark horse. But a $250 million bid (as reported elsewhere <http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/17717/penn-national- lobbies-up/> though not in the Crain's piece) puts them in the ballgame, and the company is an experienced gaming operator with a solid balance sheet <http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/aug2009/pi20090814_742719.htm> which would probably do as competent a job as anyone else. R. Donahue Peebles/MGM Mirage (20-1) didn't increase its $150 million bid, and doesn't have a lobbyist; good luck with that. Whatsmore, no local flavor and MGM Mirage has had some well-publicized financial woes (though things have been looking up of late <http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125212120561188377.html> ). Would be a major surprise.

I've followed this case Torture on homefront cries out for justice Comments <http://www.suntimes.com/news/marin/1734591,CST-EDT-caro126.article> August 26, 2009 BY CAROL MARIN <mailto:cmarin@suntimes.com> Sun-Times Columnist The feds can't -- just yet -- deport Michigan restaurateur Ibrahim Parlak to his native Turkey. But they are frighteningly closer. And the irony screams out. Carol Mann On Monday, the same day Eric Holder, President Obama's attorney general, announced he would appoint a special counsel to investigate whether torture was used by the CIA to extract confessions from foreign suspects, a U.S. appeals court at the behest of the U.S. government ruled that it didn't have a problem sending Parlak back to the country where he was tortured -- imprisoned for 17 months, shocked with electrodes, hung by his arms and sexually violated. A Turkish Kurd, Parlak was granted political asylum in 1992. It was before our government got cozier with Turkey, before it re-classified some of the Kurdish separatist movement as ""terrorist"" and before the attacks of Sept. 11. With 9/11, Ibrahim Parlak's horror began anew. Suddenly he looked different to the newly created Department of Homeland Security and to the Justice Department's Immigration courts. Instead of seeing a hard-working, tax-paying Chamber of Commerce member who ran Cafe Gulistan, a small Middle Eastern restaurant in the resort town of Harbert, Mich., tlie feds now saw an international menace. In 2004, the FBI grabbed Parlak and locked him up. If it hadn't been for a volunteer team of lawyers, including a Reagan-appointed former U.S. attorney, a former FBI anti- terrorism legal adviser and the bipartisan intervention of Michigan's Sen. Carl Levin, a liberal Democrat, and Rep. Fred Upton, a conservative Republican, Parlak would still be in jail. Thanks to them, this 47-year-old father of a 12-year-old girl is temporarily free. But just barely. The newest outrage is the 2-1 decision issued by Cincinnati's 6th Circuit Court of Appeals on the same day Holder launched his torture inquiry. B5 The majority opinion was issued by two Bush appointees put on the bench after 9/11. Judge Julia Smith Gibbons and Judge Jeffrey Sutton upheld the Justice Department's Immigration courts ruling that Parlak failed to disclose his relationship to the now-labeled terrorist organization even though he was never proven to be a member. Let's remember something about our immigration courts. They are not independent. They work for whoever is the attorney general. And the past rulings against Parlak came under two now-controversial Bush appointees, John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales. The fairness of immigration rulings has been ripped by none other than Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the nation's most brilliant judges. By September of 2005, Posner noted ""a staggering 40 percent of the 136 petitions"" had been reversed due to, according to one ruling, a willingness to ignore ""the most basic of facts."" Echoing Posner now is the dissenting judge on the Parlak appeal. Judge Boyce F. Martin, a Carter appointee, writes with both clarity and conviction, arguing the government's ""awesome power was used here to railroad a man out of our country."" Like a surgeon, Martin dissects the Justice Department's immigration courts and the majority opinion of his own colleagues, and ends by saying, ""I remain hopeful, nevertheless, that this case is but a sad remnant of an era of paranoid, overzealous, error-riddled and misguided anti-terrorism and immigration enforcement that has now gone by the wayside. It is just a shame that, even if my hope proves true, it is too late for Ibrahim Parlak."" Parlak's legal team will appeal. Meanwhile, Holder, like Ashcroft and Gonzales before him, is the new boss of the immigration courts. As he investigates questions of U.S. torture abroad, here's hoping Holder examines the ongoing domestic legal torture of Ibrahim Parlak.",-0.9848,negative,0.07527507215007216,positive,0.0,topic_0,0.6990187430048521,0.043874620807340566,0.2571066361878073

Gordon Brown this cannot come too soon After the United States Britain is the largest contributor of troops to the Nato operation in Afghanistan There has never been any suggestion that Britain has

Administration Downing Street diplomatically turns aside any suggestion that it is frustrated by the nonchalance with which it is being treated But the insistent questions on Afghanistan the anger caused by the steady stream of returning war dead and the rapid crumbling of public support for the war cannot be answered effectively until Mr Brown is taken into American confidence and seen as full

predecessor did from the taint of close association with deeply unpopular US president On the contrary like several European leaders he is still eager to position himself as close as possible to Mr Obama to clothe himself in some of the Presidents European popularity But within Government there is already worry that Britains voice counts far less than it did in the past This is not simply

I am making FM calls re Afghanistan which are going well and the memcons will describe the specific responses for our followup, especially in Athens and Brussels. Below is a memo from a concerned observer about the British feeling alienated from us. /Let me know what you each think. Thx. Consensus across the board in Britain—center, right, left—is that the Atlantic alliance—the special relationship—the historic bond since World War II—is shattered. There is no dissenting voice, not one, and there are no illusions. Opinion is unanimous. The bottom line is that the Obama administration's denigration of the UK is seen as the summation of the Bush era. Undoubtedly, you saw this week Minister of Defense Bob Ainsworth's public criticism of Obama's indecision and his accusation that the president is indifferent and damaging to British interest. While Downing Street sought to ameliorate his remarks with an oleaginous statement his view is simply what everyone—everyone—thinks. His clumsy outburst was a classic gaffe—an embarrassing mistake because it reveals something true. The Chilcot inquiry of Parliament, publicly conducting hearings on the origins of UK involvement in the Iraq invasion, has put Bush's war on terror—and British involvement—on trial—and the calmly conducted but eviscerating hearings will go on for another year. Blair is seen as either complicit on the basis of knowing there was no casus belli or as an enthusiastically deceived tool. Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has stated that the reason support for the Afghanistan mission has cratered is because of the lies told in the run-up to the Iraq war—another view universally held. Meanwhile, former UK ambassador to the US Christopher Meyer has published his new book on the history of UK diplomacy with concluding sections on the demise of the special relationship. He is not only being interviewed on all British media but also has appeared as a voluble witness before the Chi!cot commission. All British newspapers and journals have prominently published many pieces within the last week on the decline and fall of the US-UK relationship. Please see the lead editorial today from the London Times and the cover story from the Spectator—two of the most resolutely pro-American sources. The tone is not resentful, but reserved, disdainful and superior. The US administration is considered blinkered, parochial and counter-productive. Conservatives are more contemptuous than Labour, which feels abandoned and somewhat baffled. Rather than eager to be Obama's poodle, Cameron would be superficially friendly and privately scornful. Class has a lot to do with the contempt. A Cameron government would be more aristocratic and even narrowly Etonian than any Conservative government in recent history, sharply contrasting especially with the striving and classless perspective of the grocer's daughter, Margaret Thatcher. And yet, the most recent poll this week showed Labour within striking distance of the Tories, about five points down, the result of a slight economic uptick. A hung parliament seems very possible. Given the distribution of voting patterns, Labour need not win a plurality to have more seats than the Tories. The slight buoyancy for Labour in this unique situation has only heightened anxiety about Obama's Afghanistan process, which has excluded the British government from significant consultation and consideration of its interests. See the lead to Con Coughlin's Spectator piece. Therefore, the President might contemplate a brief stop in London going to or coming from Oslo or a meeting in Copenhage to make a public appearance with Brown. And, others in the Administration should pay special attention to Brown to secure strong support from him, and more importantly, the whole government and British establishment should be reassured that we do value their stalwart support despite the ups and downs of the last eight years. Pasted below is the Times editorial and the link to the Spectator article. From The Times November 26, 2009 Atlantic drift Washington's delay in announcing its Afghanistan strategy has left Brown drifting. Obama needs to invest more time and attention in the transatlantic alliance President Obama declared on Tuesday that ""the whole world"" had a responsibility to help the US-led mission in Afghanistan. He would, he said; soon lay out the ""obligations of our international partners"". Those partners have been waiting a long time for the details. On Monday the President had his tenth meeting with his advisers to work out his strategy for Afghanistan. He has now spent almost three months considering his options, and has promised an announcement on deployments after the Thanksgiving holiday. For Gordon Brown, this cannot come too soon. After the United States, Britain is the largest contributor of troops to the Nato operation in Afghanistan. There has never been any suggestion that Britain has enough soldiers to pursue a separate strategy or that it can operate independently of the US forces, which already number some 68,000 troops. Until the White House decides whether to send an extra 40,000 or some figure significantly lower than the number requested by General Stanley McChrystal, Mr Brown cannot properly plan the best support strategy. It is becoming sadly apparent that Britain has been left drifting by the delays in Washington, and that the Obama Administration is largely unaware of the embarrassment this is causing the Government. More worryingly, this does not seem to be a source of concern within the Administration. Downing Street, diplomatically, turns aside any suggestion that it is frustrated by the nonchalance with which it is being treated. But the insistent questions on Afghanistan, the anger caused by the steady stream of returning war dead and the rapid crumbling of public support for the war cannot be answered effectively until Mr Brown is taken into American confidence and seen as a full partner in the Nato campaign. On the surface, the continuing high regard in Britain for the dynamic and articulate new President has masked these growling complaints. Mr Brown is not suffering, as his predecessor did, from the taint of close association with a deeply unpopular US president. On the contrary: like several European leaders, he is still eager to position himself as close as possible to Mr Obama to clothe himself in some of the President's European popularity. But within Government, there is already worry that Britain's voice counts far less than it did in the past. This is not simply another instance of the persistent but pointless British anxiety over the so-called special relationship; it is a justified concern that two of the main pillars of the Nato alliance should have policies and strategies that are closely co-ordinated and sympathetically understood on both sides when fighting a war. The fault, glaringly, is on the American side. The White House no longer seems to be monitoring the reactions and political options of its transatlantic allies.

Mr Obama promised during his election campaign to revive trust in American leadership and to re-engage in multinational diplomacy. In office, he has certainly voiced the same ideals; but he has invested little in giving new substance and dynamism to the transatlantic relationship. On Afghanistan, Mr Brown has sometimes been left speechless by Washington. He talks of sending 500 extra troops. But until he knows the likely US strategy, he cannot outline his own. Atlanticism is always fragile on the Left and was stretched to breaking point by Tony Blair. It is now being undermined by indifference in Washington. Today America is enjoying Thanksgiving.
